This repo holds a few scripts that I used to export posts from my Jekyll blog to a blog using 11ty. In brief:

- the "layout_finder.py" identifies and removes layout frontmatter
- the "image_substitue.py" translates the markdown image link format to Nunjucks shortcode
- the "date_substitute.py" translates a date format from forward slashes to dashes

For a detailed explination of each, see [this post at my blog](https://christopherbauer.org/blog/migrating_jekyll/).
